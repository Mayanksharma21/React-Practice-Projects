## Tech Stack

- **React:** The project is built using the React library, enabling the creation of dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

- **Context API:** The Context API is utilized for state management. It allows the passing of state and functions to deeply nested components without having to pass them through each level.

- **Local Storage:** The `localStorage` API is used to persist todo data. This ensures that tasks are saved locally and retrieved upon revisiting the application.
